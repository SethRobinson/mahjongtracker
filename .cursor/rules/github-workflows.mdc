# GitHub Workflows Directory

The [.github/workflows](mdc:.github/workflows) directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files for automating tasks such as CI/CD. For example:

- [pages-noop.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/pages-noop.yml): A workflow configuration file, possibly for GitHub Pages or a placeholder action.

These files define automated processes that run on GitHub infrastructure.
