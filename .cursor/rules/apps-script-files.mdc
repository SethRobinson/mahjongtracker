# Apps Script Files Directory

The [apps_script_files](mdc:apps_script_files) directory contains the source code for the Google Apps Script project, including:

- `.gs` files for server-side logic (e.g., [teams.gs](mdc:apps_script_files/teams.gs), [github.gs](mdc:apps_script_files/github.gs), [rankings.gs](mdc:apps_script_files/rankings.gs))
- HTML files for UI components (e.g., [index.html](mdc:apps_script_files/index.html), [ranking.html](mdc:apps_script_files/ranking.html))
- [appsscript.json](mdc:apps_script_files/appsscript.json) for project configuration
- [project_metadata.json](mdc:apps_script_files/project_metadata.json) for metadata

This directory is the main source for the Google Apps Script application logic and UI.

## Sync reminder

- After editing any files under `apps_script_files/`, run `python apps_script_sync.py upload`.
- On Windows/PowerShell, run the command without piping.
- If you change `apps_script_files/index.html` or any `.gs` files, upload before testing in Sheets.
